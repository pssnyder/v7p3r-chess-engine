# V7P3R v10.8 Recovery Baseline Report

## Overview
V7P3R v10.8 represents a recovery baseline built from v10.6 logic after the v10.7 tournament performance issues. This version maintains the stable foundations while preserving clear version lineage for future development.

| **Base Logic** | v10.6 (tactical patterns disabled) | ‚úÖ VERIFIED |
| **UCI Compliance** | Full UCI protocol support | ‚úÖ TESTED |
| **NPS Performance** | 2400-2800 (healthy) | ‚úÖ CONFIRMED |
| **Expected Puzzle ELO** | ~1603 (v10.6 baseline) | ‚è≥ ESTIMATED |
| **Build Status** | Successful PyInstaller build | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |

## Recovery Rationale

### Why v10.8?
1. **Version Lineage**: Maintains clear progression from failed v10.7
2. **Clean Slate**: Establishes stable baseline for future Phase 3B redesign
3. **Documentation**: Preserves lessons learned from v10.7 investigation
4. **User Intent**: "Go back to the drawing board" with solid foundation

### What's Different from v10.6?
- **Code**: Identical logic, tactical patterns properly disabled
- **Header**: Updated to reflect v10.8 recovery status
- **Documentation**: Enhanced with v10.7 investigation findings
- **Build**: New PyInstaller spec and executable

## Expected Performance

### Puzzle Solving (Estimated)
Based on v10.6 historical performance:
- **Target ELO**: ~1603 (baseline tactical performance)
- **Confidence**: High (identical evaluation logic)
- **Verification**: Pending full puzzle analysis

### Tournament Play
Based on v10.6 proven stability:
- **Expected Score**: 19.5/30 (65% win rate)
- **NPS Range**: 2400-2800 (stable performance)
- **Time Management**: Healthy, no timeout issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Git Commit)
1. ‚úÖ Build v10.8 executable
2. ‚úÖ Verify UCI compliance
3. ‚úÖ Confirm basic functionality
4. ‚è≥ **IN PROGRESS**: Document recovery baseline
5. üîÑ **NEXT**: Commit to git with documentation

### Future Development (v11 Planning)
1. **Phase 3B Redesign**: Time-aware tactical pattern system
2. **Performance Optimization**: Maintain 2400+ NPS with advanced features
3. **Testing Framework**: Enhanced puzzle and tournament validation
4. **Architecture Review**: Modular components for easy feature toggling

## Lessons Learned Integration

### From v10.7 Investigation
- **Performance First**: NPS degradation kills tournament viability
- **Context Matters**: Puzzle success ‚â† tournament success
- **Time Awareness**: All advanced features must respect UCI time controls
- **Testing Scope**: Both puzzle AND tournament validation required

### For v11 Development
- **Incremental Changes**: Small feature additions with performance monitoring
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Puzzle + tournament + regression validation
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain working baselines at all times
- **Documentation**: Record performance impact of each change
