## üîß Technical Implementation Plan

### Enhanced Evaluation Architecture
```python
class V7P3RAdvancedEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, bitboard_evaluator):
        self.base_evaluator = bitboard_evaluator
        self.pawn_evaluator = AdvancedPawnEvaluator()
        self.king_safety = KingSafetyEvaluator()
        self.piece_activity = PieceActivityEvaluator()
        self.tactical_detector = TacticalPatternDetector()
        
    def evaluate_position_advanced(self, board):
        # Base evaluation from bitboards
        base_score = self.base_evaluator.calculate_score_optimized(board)
        
        # Advanced components
        pawn_score = self.pawn_evaluator.evaluate(board)
        king_score = self.king_safety.evaluate(board)
        activity_score = self.piece_activity.evaluate(board)
        tactical_score = self.tactical_detector.evaluate(board)
        
        return base_score + pawn_score + king_score + activity_score + tactical_score
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Nudge System**: Enhanced with tactical pattern awareness
- **Search**: Position-based extensions and pruning
- **Time Management**: Strategic position complexity factors
- **Move Ordering**: Tactical pattern bonuses
