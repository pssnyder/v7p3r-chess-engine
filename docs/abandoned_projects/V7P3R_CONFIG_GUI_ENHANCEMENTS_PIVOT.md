# V7P3R Config GUI Modernization - Update

## Implemented Changes

1. Added `delete_config` function to handle deleting configuration files
   - Located in the file utility section alongside other config management functions
   - Handles JSON extension and proper file path construction
   - Returns success/error status with appropriate messages

2. Implemented `_delete_selected_config` method in the ConfigGUI class
   - Gets the selected configuration from the dropdown
   - Confirms deletion with the user via a messagebox
   - Calls the `delete_config` function and handles the result
   - Updates the config list after successful deletion
   - Logs actions using the centralized logger

3. Implemented `_validate_json` method in the ConfigGUI class
   - Validates JSON structure and content
   - Checks for valid JSON format and validates against schema
   - Provides user feedback through messageboxes
   - Logs validation results using the centralized logger

## Remaining Work

Several methods are still referenced in the GUI but not implemented:

1. Form-related methods:
   - `_update_form_from_config`: Updates form fields based on loaded config
   - `_save_form_config`: Saves form configuration to a file
   - `_load_form_to_json`: Loads form data to the JSON editor
   - `_build_config_from_form`: Builds config data from form values
   - `_save_json_config`: Saves JSON from editor to a file
   - `_load_json_to_form`: Loads JSON data to the form

2. Ruleset-related methods:
   - `_save_ruleset_editor`: Saves ruleset from editor
   - `_load_ruleset_editor`: Loads ruleset into editor
   - `_reset_ruleset_editor`: Resets ruleset editor to defaults
   - `_new_ruleset_from_form`: Creates new ruleset from form
   - `_edit_selected_engine_ruleset`: Edits selected ruleset

3. Other methods:
   - `_browse_stockfish`: Browses for Stockfish executable

4. Missing initialization for Tkinter variables:
   - `starting_pos_var`, `verbose_output_var`, `elo_rating_var`, etc. 

## Next Steps

1. Implement the remaining methods referenced in the GUI
2. Initialize all required Tkinter variables
3. Test the complete GUI functionality
4. Document the modernization process
