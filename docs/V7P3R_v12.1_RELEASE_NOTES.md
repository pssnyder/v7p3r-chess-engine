# V7P3R Chess Engine v12.1 Release Notes

## Version: v12.1
**Release Date:** September 22, 2025  
**Build Target:** Standalone executable with embedded nudge database

---

## 🎯 Overview

V7P3R v12.1 is a significant heuristic improvement release focusing on better king safety, opening play, and draw avoidance. This version builds upon the clean v12.0 foundation with tactical enhancements designed to make the engine more aggressive and strategically sound.

---

## ✨ New Features & Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced King Safety (Castling Bonus)**
- **Increased castling score from +20/+15 to +40/+30**
- Kingside castling: +40 bonus (was +20)
- Queenside castling: +30 bonus (was +15)
- **Result:** Engine now prioritizes king safety much more highly

### 2. **Opening Center Control**
- **Added center control bonus for minor pieces in opening**
- Knights and bishops on central squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) receive +5 bonus
- Only applies when total material ≥ 12 (opening/middlegame)
- **Result:** More aggressive piece development toward center

### 3. **Development Penalties**
- **Penalties for undeveloped knights and bishops**
- Knights on starting squares (b1, g1, b8, g8): -8 penalty each
- Bishops on starting squares (c1, f1, c8, f8): -6 penalty each
- Only applies when total material ≥ 12 (opening/middlegame)
- **Result:** Engine actively develops pieces instead of moving pawns repeatedly

### 4. **Stricter Draw Prevention**
- **Fifty-move rule awareness:** Escalating penalties as halfmove clock approaches 50
  - Penalty starts at 30 halfmoves: (halfmove_clock - 30) × 2.0
  - Example: At 40 halfmoves = -20 penalty, at 45 halfmoves = -30 penalty
- **Repetition penalties:** -25 per detected position repetition in recent moves
- **Activity enforcement:** Penalties for pieces staying on back ranks in middlegame
  - -3 per piece on ranks 1-2 (White) or 7-8 (Black) during middlegame
- **Result:** Engine avoids passive play and actively seeks winning chances

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Files Modified
- **`src/v7p3r_bitboard_evaluator.py`**: Primary heuristic implementation
- **`src/v7p3r_uci.py`**: Version string updated to v12.1

### Heuristic Integration
All new features are seamlessly integrated into the existing bitboard evaluation pipeline:
1. Material calculation determines game phase
2. Position-based bonuses/penalties applied conditionally
3. Smooth integration with existing tactical and positional evaluation

### Performance Impact
- **Negligible performance cost**: All new heuristics use efficient bitboard operations
- **No search depth impact**: Changes only affect position evaluation
- **Memory usage**: No increase in memory requirements

---

## 📊 Validation Results

### Test Suite: `test_v12_1_heuristics.py`
✅ **Castling Bonus Test**: Detected +40.0 bonus (as expected)  
✅ **Center Control Test**: +3.0 improvement for developed position  
✅ **Development Test**: +15.0 bonus for developed vs starting position  
✅ **Draw Prevention Test**: +10.0 penalty for high halfmove clock  
✅ **Basic Functionality**: Engine suggests valid moves correctly  

**Result**: 5/5 tests passed - All heuristics working as designed
