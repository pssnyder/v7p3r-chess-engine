# V7P3R v6.1 - Time Management & Search Optimization

## Current Issues Identified
1. **Poor Time Allocation**: Engine gets very little time per move, can't reach meaningful search depths
2. **Inefficient Iterative Deepening**: Resets everything each iteration, doesn't build on previous results
3. **Slow Move Ordering**: Takes too long to identify good moves early in search
4. **No Best Move Propagation**: Doesn't carry forward best moves from previous iterations
5. **Overly Conservative Time Management**: Leaves too much time unused

## Proposed Solutions for v6.1

### 1. Aggressive Time Allocation
- Increase time allocation especially for opening/middlegame
- Use more of available time when position is complex
- Reduce safety margins that leave time unused

### 2. Enhanced Iterative Deepening
- Start each iteration with best move from previous iteration
- Use aspiration windows around previous score
- Better time management integration per iteration
- Smarter stopping criteria

### 3. Improved Move Ordering
- Prioritize previous iteration's best move
- Better killer move integration
- History heuristics for move ordering
- Capture moves sorted by MVV-LVA early

### 4. Integrated Time Management
- Remove separate time_manager.py dependency
- Integrate time management directly into search
- Dynamic time allocation based on search progress
- Emergency time handling for critical positions

### 5. Search Efficiency Improvements
- Faster evaluation calls
- Better pruning in non-critical positions  
- Quiescence search optimization
- Transposition table improvements

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Integrated Search & Time Management
1. Create new `search_with_time_management()` function
2. Integrate time allocation directly into search loop
3. Remove dependency on separate time manager
4. Implement proper iterative deepening with best move propagation

### Phase 2: Move Ordering Optimization
1. Enhance move ordering to find good moves faster
2. Implement better killer move tracking
3. Add history heuristics for move prioritization
4. Optimize capture move ordering

### Phase 3: Time Allocation Tuning
1. More aggressive time usage in opening/middlegame
2. Dynamic time allocation based on position complexity
3. Better handling of increment time controls
4. Emergency time management for time pressure

## Expected Results
- Engine reaches depth 4-6 consistently in tournament time controls
- Good opening moves found within 1-2 seconds
- Better time utilization (use 80-90% of allocated time vs current 20-30%)
- Stronger tactical play due to deeper search
- More consistent performance across different time controls

## Risk Mitigation
- Keep backup of current working engine
- Implement changes incrementally
- Test each phase before proceeding
- Maintain compatibility with UCI protocol
