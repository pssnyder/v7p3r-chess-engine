# V7P3R Move Ordering Analysis Report

## Summary
- **Overall Score**: 44.2% (POOR - needs significant improvement)
- **Capture Prioritization**: 58.3% (FAIR)
- **Check Prioritization**: 19.3% (POOR)
- **Move Ranking Accuracy**: 55.0% (FAIR)

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Excellent Consistency**: 100% move ordering consistency across multiple runs
2. **Good Capture Recognition**: Successfully identifies and prioritizes captures
3. **Fast Performance**: Move ordering takes only 0.20-2.13ms per position
4. **Promotion Handling**: Correctly prioritizes promotion moves (Position 5)

### ‚ùå Weaknesses  
1. **Poor Central Pawn Moves**: e2e4 ranked 16/20, d2d4 ranked 17/20 in starting position
2. **Check Prioritization**: Only 19.3% average - checking moves not prioritized enough
3. **Expected Move Recognition**: Many expected "good moves" not found (possibly illegal)
4. **Knight Development**: Over-prioritizes knight to edge (Nh3) vs center (Nf3, Nc3)

### üîç Detailed Position Analysis

#### Position 1 (Opening)
- **Issue**: Central pawns (e4, d4) ranked very low (16th, 17th out of 20)
- **Good**: Knight development to f3, c3 ranked high (2nd, 3rd)
- **Problem**: Nh3 ranked 1st (poor opening move)

#### Position 2 (Kiwipete - Tactical)
- **Excellent**: Captures properly prioritized (ranks 1-8)
- **Good**: Tactical moves like d5e6, e5f7 found early
- **Score**: 91.7% ranking accuracy

#### Position 3 (Endgame)
- **Excellent**: Check+capture combination (b4f4) ranked 1st
- **Good**: Checking moves prioritized (g2g3 ranked 2nd)
- **Score**: Only 64.3% due to expected moves not being legal

#### Position 4 (Complex Tactical)
- **Issue**: Only 6 legal moves, all expected moves were illegal
- **Neutral**: Limited data for analysis

#### Position 5 (Promotion Position)
- **Excellent**: Promotion captures ranked 1st-4th
- **Good**: Other captures prioritized (e1f2, c4f7)
- **Issue**: e2f4 ranked very low (30th out of 44)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Central Pawn Opening Bonus**: Add bonus for e2e4, d2d4 in opening positions
2. **Check Move Prioritization**: Increase scoring for checking moves
3. **Knight Development**: Penalize knight moves to edge squares (a3, h3) in opening

### Medium Priority  
1. **Position-Specific Bonuses**: Add game phase awareness to move scoring
2. **Piece Activity**: Bonus for moves that improve piece activity
3. **King Safety**: Consider king safety in move ordering

### Implementation Suggestions
```python
# In _order_moves_advanced method:
if is_opening_position(board):
    if move.uci() in ['e2e4', 'd2d4', 'e7e5', 'd7d5']:
        move_scores[move] += 50  # Central pawn bonus
    
    # Penalize knight to edge in opening
    if move.from_square in [chess.B1, chess.G1] and move.to_square in [chess.A3, chess.H3]:
        move_scores[move] -= 30

if board.gives_check(move):
    move_scores[move] += 60  # Increase check bonus
```

## Performance Impact
- Move ordering is very fast (< 3ms per position)
- Improvement focus should be on move quality, not speed
- Current ordering shows good understanding of captures and basic tactics

## Next Steps
1. Implement central pawn opening bonuses
2. Increase check move prioritization
3. Add knight development penalties
4. Test improvements on tactical puzzle positions
5. Measure search performance impact of better move ordering
