# V7P3R v10.7 Development Plan - Complete Feature Integration
## Goal: Re-enable Phase 3B with Enhanced Timeout Protection

### Target Performance
- **Minimum Puzzle Rating**: 1604+ (current: 1603)
- **Target Goal**: 1650+ (preparing for v11 → 1800+)
- **All Features Enabled**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3A + Phase 3B

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 3B Tactical Pattern Integration
1. **Timeout-Protected Evaluation**
   - Implement adaptive timeout checking within tactical pattern evaluation
   - Fallback to basic evaluation if tactical analysis exceeds time limits
   - Configurable tactical intensity based on available time

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Cache tactical pattern results to reduce computation
   - Early exit conditions for low-value tactical patterns
   - Selective pattern detection based on position type

3. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Graceful degradation when tactical evaluation fails
   - Comprehensive exception handling with logging
   - Automatic fallback to v10.6 evaluation mode

#### Technical Implementation
1. **Re-enable Tactical Pattern Detector Import**
2. **Restore Tactical Evaluation in `_evaluate_position()`**
3. **Restore Tactical Move Ordering in `_detect_bitboard_tactics()`**
4. **Add Timeout Protection Wrapper**
5. **Update Build Specification**

#### Success Criteria
- [X] Successful build with all components enabled
- [X] Puzzle rating ≥ 1604 (minimum requirement)
- [X] No timeout failures in 50-puzzle test
- [X] Stable UCI protocol operation
- [X] Performance improvement over v10.6

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Testing**: Build → Quick Test → Full Analysis
- **Rollback Ready**: Keep v10.6 as stable fallback
- **Performance Monitoring**: Compare directly against v10.6
- **Tournament Testing**: 700-game regression analysis

**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Timeline**: Immediate development and testing
