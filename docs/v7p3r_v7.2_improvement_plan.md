V7P3R v7.2 Performance Analysis and Improvement Plan

Based on analysis of game records from Engine Battle 20250824:

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Time Management:
   - V7P3R using 12-33 seconds per move (excessive)
   - SlowMate consistently uses 7-10 seconds (much more efficient)
   - Need aggressive time management improvements

2. Search Efficiency:
   - Still some mate evaluation issues (+M500 in records)
   - Deep search explosion in complex positions
   - Need better pruning and move ordering

3. Evaluation Performance:
   - Overly complex evaluation causing slowdowns
   - Need to optimize heuristics for speed vs accuracy

4. Move Ordering:
   - Insufficient move ordering causing poor alpha-beta pruning
   - Need improved MVV-LVA and killer move heuristics

IMPROVEMENT TARGETS (V7.2):
1. Time Management Overhaul
2. Move Ordering Optimization  
3. Evaluation Streamlining
4. Better Pruning Techniques
5. Search Depth Management

PERFORMANCE GOALS:
- Reduce average move time to 8-12 seconds
- Maintain tactical strength while improving speed
- Compete effectively with SlowMate's efficiency
