# V13 "Capablanca" Integration Plan

## Overview
Transform V7P3R from tactical "Tal experiments" to positional "Capablanca" simplification engine. This addresses the core issue of "low rating engine syndrome" where our best move assumptions are flawed.

## Key Architecture Changes

### 1. Dual-Brain Evaluation System
**Problem:** Our engine assumes both players will play "best moves" but our definition of "best" is limited by builder rating
**Solution:** Different evaluation complexity based on whose move we're analyzing

```python
# Our moves: Complex evaluation with all heuristics
our_eval = dual_brain_evaluator.evaluate_position(board, PlayerPerspective.OUR_MOVE)

# Opponent moves: Simplified evaluation (material + basic threats only)
opp_eval = dual_brain_evaluator.evaluate_position(board, PlayerPerspective.OPPONENT_MOVE)
```

### 2. Asymmetric Pruning Strategy
**Problem:** We prune opponent moves too aggressively based on flawed "worst move" detection
**Solution:** Conservative pruning for opponent moves, aggressive for our moves

```python
# Our moves: Keep top 60% (trust our evaluation)
our_moves = move_orderer.order_moves_capablanca(board, PlayerPerspective.OUR_MOVE)

# Opponent moves: Keep top 80% (conservative due to evaluation uncertainty)  
opp_moves = move_orderer.order_moves_capablanca(board, PlayerPerspective.OPPONENT_MOVE)
```

### 3. Simplification Priority System
**Problem:** Engine gets lost in complex positions, struggles with calculation depth
**Solution:** Actively seek simplification through equal trades and pawn removal

```python
# Priority order for move selection:
1. Immediate recaptures (clear and simple)
2. Equal trades that remove pieces (simplification)
3. Pawn trades (reduce complexity)
4. Development moves (familiar patterns)
5. Only then tactical complications
```

### 4. Position Complexity Scoring
**Problem:** No systematic way to measure position difficulty
**Solution:** Mathematical complexity framework based on 4 metrics

```python
complexity = PositionComplexity(
    optionality=0.7,      # Many plausible moves (decision width)
    volatility=0.3,       # Evaluation stability across depths  
    tactical_density=0.8, # Forcing moves (checks/captures)
    novelty=0.4          # Position rarity/unfamiliarity
)
total_complexity = 0.3*opt + 0.4*vol + 0.2*tac + 0.1*nov
```

### 5. Early Search Exit Logic
**Problem:** Overthinking positions where multiple good moves exist
**Solution:** Exit early with "good enough" moves that don't lose material

```python
if search_controller.should_exit_early(board, best_move, eval, depth, time_remaining):
    # Conditions:
    # 1. Move doesn't lose material (eval > -50cp)
    # 2. Simple position (few forcing moves)
    # 3. Time pressure (bullet games)
    # 4. Winning position (can play safely)
    return best_move
```

- **Position Clarity:** Simplification preference leads to more manageable positions

### Playing Style Changes
- **From Tactical Complexity → Positional Simplicity**
- **From Deep Calculation → Quick Good Decisions** 
- **From Equal Evaluation → Perspective-Aware Assessment**
- **From Rigid Pruning → Adaptive Uncertainty Management**

### Competitive Advantages
- **Bullet Games:** Early exit logic provides significant time advantage
- **Complex Positions:** Complexity scoring guides search allocation
- **Opponent Modeling:** Dual-brain system accounts for player strength differences
- **Endgame Play:** Simplification preference improves endgame transitions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Dual-brain evaluation consistency
- Complexity scoring accuracy
- Move ordering correctness
- Early exit decision quality

### Integration Tests  
- Search performance with Capablanca components
- NPS impact of dual-brain system
- Memory usage of complexity caching
- Tournament compatibility

### Competitive Testing
- Arena matches against V12.6 baseline
- Bullet vs longer time control performance

- Rating improvement measurement

## Metrics to Track

### Capablanca-Specific Metrics
- `simplifications_made`: Equal trades executed
- `early_exits`: Quick decisions under time pressure
- `dual_brain_evals`: Evaluation perspective switches
- `complexity_based_pruning`: Moves pruned due to complexity
- `recaptures_executed`: Immediate recaptures played

### Performance Metrics
- **NPS Impact:** Target <10% reduction from dual-brain overhead
- **Search Depth:** Maintain competitive depth with early exits
- **Move Quality:** Simplification should not reduce tactical accuracy
- **Time Management:** Better bullet game performance

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Integrate CapablancaDualBrainEvaluator into main search
