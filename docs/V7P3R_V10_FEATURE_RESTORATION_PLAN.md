# V7P3R V10 Feature Restoration Plan

## Current Status - MAJOR PROGRESS ✅
- ✅ Clean codebase (399 lines, no duplicates)
- ✅ Performance target achieved (8,000+ NPS with full features)
- ✅ Bitboard evaluation working
- ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: TT, Move Ordering, Null Move Pruning
- ✅ **Phase 2 COMPLETE**: LMR, Quiescence Search
- ✅ **Phase 3 COMPLETE**: Full PV Display, PV Following (>100x speedup)
- ✅ **BONUS**: Bitboard Tactical Awareness (pins, forks, skewers)

## Phase 1: Core Search Features ✅ COMPLETE
### Step 1: Transposition Table ✅
### Step 2: Enhanced Move Ordering ✅  
### Step 3: Null Move Pruning ✅

## Phase 2: Tactical Features ✅ COMPLETE
### Step 4: Late Move Reduction (LMR) ✅
### Step 5: Quiescence Search ✅

## Phase 3: Advanced Features ✅ COMPLETE
### Step 6: Principal Variation (PV) Extraction & Following ✅
- Full PV display working perfectly
- PV following providing >100x speedup on expected lines

### Step 7: Aspiration Windows
- **Goal**: Narrow search windows for speed
- **Expected Impact**: 10-20% speedup
- **Risk**: Medium - can cause research overhead

### Step 8: Tactical Pattern Detection
- **Goal**: Add back pin, fork, skewer detection as bonuses
- **Expected Impact**: Stronger tactical play
- **Risk**: High - was causing major slowdown before

## Testing Strategy
After each step:
1. Run performance test (target: maintain 12,000+ NPS)
2. Run tactical test positions
3. Compare strength vs previous version
4. If performance drops below 10,000 NPS, rollback and optimize

## Success Criteria
- Maintain 12,000+ NPS minimum
- Pass all tactical test positions
- Stronger play than V9.2
- Stable, no crashes or infinite loops
