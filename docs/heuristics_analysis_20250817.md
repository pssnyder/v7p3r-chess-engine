V7P3R Chess Engine Heuristics Analysis
=====================================

MOVE ORDERING HEURISTICS (v7p3r_move_ordering.py)
=================================================
Current Priority Order in _score_move():

1. CHECKMATE DETECTION: +1,000,000
   - board_copy.is_checkmate() after move

2. REPETITION AVOIDANCE: -500,000  
   - board_copy.is_repetition(2)

3. FREE MATERIAL CAPTURES: +800,000 to +800,600
   - get_hanging_piece_captures() -> find_hanging_pieces()
   - Calls MVV-LVA find_hanging_pieces which does full board scan

4. GOOD CAPTURES: +700,000 to +700,600
   - MVV-LVA.is_free_capture() + material_gain analysis
   - Another full exchange evaluation

5. CHECKS: +600,000
   - board_copy.is_check() after move

6. PROMOTIONS: +500,000 + piece_value
   - move.promotion checks

7. CASTLING: +3,000
   - board.is_castling(move)

8. PIECE SQUARE TABLES: +/-2,000
   - PST evaluation for move

9. TACTICAL PATTERNS: +/-1,000
   - Various tactical heuristics

10. QUIET MOVES: +50
    - Default score for non-special moves

SEARCH HEURISTICS (v7p3r_search.py) 
===================================
In find_best_move() before main search:

1. HANGING CAPTURES (Priority 1):
   - get_hanging_piece_captures() - SAME as move ordering!
   - Early return if found

2. CHECKMATE IN ONE (Priority 2): 
   - Loops through ALL legal moves
   - board.push/pop + is_checkmate() for each
   - Can be 20-50+ moves in middle game!

3. MAIN SEARCH (Priority 3):
   - _negamax_root with full move ordering

QUIESCENCE HEURISTICS (v7p3r_quiescence.py)
===========================================

1. CAPTURE GENERATION:
   - _get_capture_moves() - only captures

2. MVV-LVA SORTING:
   - mvv_lva.sort_captures() - another sort

3. BAD CAPTURE FILTERING:
   - _is_bad_capture() using Static Exchange Evaluation

4. RECURSIVE CAPTURE SEARCH:
   - Up to max_quiescence_depth = 5 levels

EVALUATION HEURISTICS (v7p3r_scoring.py + others)
=================================================

PRIMARY SCORING:
- Material count and balance
- Basic piece positioning
- King safety fundamentals

SECONDARY SCORING:
- Advanced piece positioning
- Pawn structure analysis
- Tactical pattern recognition

TEMPO SCORING:
- Move initiative evaluation
- Development assessment

PST SCORING:
- Piece-square table evaluation
- Position-specific piece values

REDUNDANCY AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
============================================

1. HANGING PIECE DETECTION CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES:
   - find_best_move() calls get_hanging_piece_captures()
   - Move ordering ALSO calls get_hanging_piece_captures()
   - Both do full board scans with MVV-LVA logic

2. CHECKMATE DETECTION DONE TWICE:
   - find_best_move() loops through ALL moves checking for mate-in-1
   - Move ordering ALSO checks for checkmate for each move

3. MOVE GENERATION REDUNDANCY:
   - legal_moves = list(board.legal_moves) called multiple times
   - Checkmate-in-1 scan generates moves again
   - Quiescence generates captures separately

4. EXCHANGE EVALUATION OVERLAP:
   - MVV-LVA has is_free_capture()
   - Utils has evaluate_exchange()  
   - Quiescence has _is_bad_capture()
   - All doing similar SEE-style analysis

5. BOARD COPY OPERATIONS:
   - Multiple board.copy().push() operations for analysis
   - Very expensive in Python chess library

PROPOSED SIMPLIFICATION:
========================

MOVE ORDERING (Keep Essential Only):
- Captures (simple MVV-LVA score only)
- Checks  
- Promotions
- Pieces attacked by pawns
- PST bonus/penalty

SEARCH (Streamline):
- Remove hanging piece pre-check (let move ordering handle)
- Remove checkmate-in-1 scan (expensive, rare benefit)
- Rely on evaluation to find tactics

EVALUATION (Consolidate):
- Single exchange evaluation function
- Unified hanging piece detection
- Simplified tactical pattern recognition

QUIESCENCE (Focus):
- Only captures and checks
- Simple MVV-LVA ordering
- Basic SEE for pruning
