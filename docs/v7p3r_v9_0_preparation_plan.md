Generated: 2025-08-29 10:21:51

## Overview
V9.0 represents the consolidation of all V8.x series improvements into a stable, tournament-ready chess engine.

## V8.x Series Summary
- **V8.1**: Contextual and tactical move ordering improvements
- **V8.2**: Enhanced move ordering implementation and UCI improvements  
- **V8.3**: Memory management, LRU caching, and performance monitoring
- **V8.4**: Testing framework and heuristic research platform

## V9.0 Consolidation Tasks

### Consolidation Targets
- [X] Integrate V8.3 memory management into main engine
- [X] Consolidate all V8.x UCI improvements
- [X] Merge performance monitoring system
- [X] Update version identifiers to V9.0

### Validation Requirements
- [X] Full UCI compliance testing
- [X] Tournament time control validation
- [X] Memory efficiency under stress
- [X] Performance regression testing
- [X] Engine vs engine battles

### Build Requirements
- [X] Clean build process
- [X] Executable generation
- [X] Tournament package creation
- [X] Documentation update

## Integration Checklist

### Core Engine Integration
- [X] Merge V8.3 memory manager into main engine
