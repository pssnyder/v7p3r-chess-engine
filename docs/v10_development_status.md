# Current Status: Back to V7.0 Foundation

## ✅ COMPLETED: Engine Cleanup
- Fixed `src/v7p3r.py` to use `V7P3RScoringCalculationClean` (V7.0 scoring)
- Removed confusion about which scoring calculation is active
- Current NPS: ~5,000-7,000 (much better than V9.3's terrible performance)
- Evaluation speed: ~47,500 evals/sec (close to V7.0's 58,600)

## 📊 Performance Comparison Summary:
- **V7.0 Original**: 58,638 evaluations/second
- **V9.3 Complex**: 11,556 evaluations/second (5.1x slower!)
- **Current Engine**: 47,517 evaluations/second (restored to reasonable speed)

## 🎯 Next Steps for V10.0 Development:

### Phase 1: Validate V7.0 Foundation ✅
- ✅ Engine uses V7.0 scoring 
- ✅ Performance measured and documented
- ⏳ Need: Head-to-head test vs original V7.0 to confirm equivalent strength

### Phase 2: Incremental Improvements (One at a time)
**Strict criteria: Each improvement must:**
1. Maintain >80% of current NPS performance  
2. Win >60% vs current version in 20+ game test
3. Be simple and debuggable

**Improvement candidates (in priority order):**

1. **King Safety Enhancement** (Low risk)
   - Add simple attack counting near king
   - Only in middlegame (not every evaluation)
   - Estimated cost: <5% NPS impact

2. **Endgame Pawn Promotion** (Proven effective)
   - Simple distance-to-promotion bonus
   - Only in endgame phase
   - Already shown effective in V9.4 testing

3. **Basic Tactical Awareness** (Medium risk)
   - Knight fork detection in center squares only
   - No complex pin/skewer detection
   - Estimate: 10-15% NPS cost

4. **Opening Principles** (Static only)
   - Penalty for early queen (position-based, not move counting)
   - Knights before bishops bonus
   - No move history analysis

### Phase 3: Version Control
- Each improvement gets its own commit
- Maintain rollback capability
- Document exact performance impact

## 🚨 Things We Will NOT Add (Lessons from V9.x failure):
- ❌ Complex piece-square tables
- ❌ Move counting heuristics  
- ❌ Complex tactical detection in evaluation
- ❌ Multiple helper functions per evaluation
- ❌ Opening move analysis
- ❌ Complex pawn structure analysis

## 📈 Success Metrics for V10.0:
- **Tournament win rate**: >80% (beat V7.0's 79.5%)
- **NPS performance**: >40,000 evaluations/second
- **Head-to-head vs V7.0**: >65% win rate
- **Code complexity**: <250 lines evaluation code

## The V10.0 Philosophy:
**"V7.0's proven simplicity + minimal, proven improvements"**

Speed is king. Simplicity wins. Prove every addition.
