V13.2 PUZZLE SOLVER ALGORITHM - Conceptual Framework
Based on user's insight: "Turn chess into a one-sided massive puzzle"

CORE PRINCIPLE: 
Instead of "what's best assuming opponent plays optimally"
We ask "what gives us the best improvement regardless of opponent response"

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM TRADITIONAL MINIMAX:
1. No opponent modeling - we don't predict their moves
2. Multi-PV approach - we maintain multiple good options
3. Position-to-position improvement focus
4. Dynamic evaluation scaling based on game phase
5. Width over depth for practical play

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

1. MULTI-PV NATURE:
   - We naturally get multiple good moves
   - Can switch between them based on opponent responses
   - More flexible than single "best" move

2. PRACTICAL PLAY:
   - Focuses on improvement over perfection
   - Exploits opponent weaknesses naturally
   - Doesn't assume opponent perfection

3. RATING-APPROPRIATE:
   - Lower ratings: Wide thinking, opportunity recognition
   - Doesn't over-calculate against imperfect opponents

4. COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY:
   - No complex minimax alternation
   - Can use asymmetric search depths naturally
   - Simpler evaluation caching

5. DYNAMIC SCALING:
   - Can adjust "sample size" of opponent moves by rating/time
   - Can focus on different aspects by game phase
   - Natural integration with diminishing evaluation
