# V7P3R Chess Engine MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for building a complete V7P3R chess engine MVP that can play against Stockfish according to the design specifications.

## Goals
- Create a functional chess engine that makes moves in under 30 seconds
- Beat Stockfish at ELO 400 approximately 10% of the time (100 of 1000 non-drawn games)
- Follow modular architecture for easy iteration and improvement
- Implement core functionality without unnecessary complexity

## Current State Analysis
- `v7p3r_engine.py`: Contains empty class skeleton
- `metrics.py`: Contains empty class skeleton  
- `active_game_watcher.py`: Complete PGN watcher implementation
- `config.json`: Complete configuration with all required settings
- `stockfish.exe`: Available for opponent testing
- Images and PGN data: Available for UI and opening book

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Dependencies and Infrastructure
**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `requirements.txt` - Add python-chess, pygame, stockfish dependencies
- `v7p3r_config.py` - Configuration handler module
- `play_chess.py` - Main game runner and entry point

**Description:** Set up basic infrastructure and dependencies needed for the engine.

### Phase 2: Core Engine Components  
**Files to Create:**
- `v7p3r_search.py` - Search controller (negamax, simple search)
- `v7p3r_scoring.py` - Position evaluation and scoring
- `v7p3r_rules.py` - Game rules and position analysis
- `v7p3r_book.py` - Opening book handler

**Description:** Implement the core search and evaluation components.

### Phase 3: Supporting Modules
**Files to Create:**
- `v7p3r_move_ordering.py` - Move ordering and pruning
- `v7p3r_tempo.py` - Critical move detection (checkmate/stalemate)
- `v7p3r_primary_scoring.py` - Material and PST evaluation
- `v7p3r_secondary_scoring.py` - Castling and tactical scoring
- `v7p3r_pst.py` - Piece square tables
- `v7p3r_mvv_lva.py` - Capture evaluation
- `v7p3r_quiescence.py` - Quiet position search

**Description:** Build out specialized evaluation modules.

### Phase 4: Game Integration
**Files to Create/Complete:**
- `v7p3r_game.py` - Main game controller with pygame UI
- `v7p3r_stockfish.py` - Stockfish interface handler
- Complete `v7p3r_engine.py` - Main engine coordinator
- Complete `metrics.py` - Game and move metrics

**Description:** Integrate all components into a working game.

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
**Files to Create:**
- `testing/test_basic_functionality.py` - Basic engine tests
- `testing/test_vs_stockfish.py` - Automated testing vs Stockfish

**Description:** Validate engine performance and fix any issues.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds on the previous, allowing testing at each stage
2. **Modular Design**: Each module has a single responsibility and clear interfaces
3. **Performance First**: Focus on move time targets over complex features
4. **Configuration Driven**: Use existing config.json to control all engine behavior

## Risk Mitigation
- Keep backups of working versions at each phase
- Test each module individually before integration  
- Use simple algorithms initially, optimize later
- Fallback to simple search if negamax fails

## Success Criteria
- Engine can complete a full game against Stockfish
- Move times consistently under 30 seconds
- No crashes or illegal moves
- Basic win rate validation against weak Stockfish

## Dependencies Required
- python-chess: Chess board representation and move generation
- pygame: Game UI and rendering
- stockfish: Python interface to Stockfish engine
- sqlite3: Metrics database (built-in)

## Configuration
The implementation will be driven by the existing config.json file structure, respecting all the specified flags and settings for modular enabling/disabling of features.
