# V7P3R Chess Engine V8.3 - Memory Optimization & Performance Auditing Plan

## Overview
V8.3 focuses on memory management, waste reduction, and establishing comprehensive performance baselines to enable future heuristic research and optimization.

## Memory Management Targets

### 1. Transposition Table Optimization
**Current State:** Simple dictionary-based storage
**Target Improvements:**
- Dynamic sizing based on game phase and position complexity
- LRU eviction strategy for memory pressure
- Separate tables for different data types (positions, evaluations, PV lines)
- Memory pool management to reduce allocation overhead

### 2. Killer Moves & History Heuristics Optimization
**Current State:** Unbounded dictionaries that grow throughout the game
**Target Improvements:**
- Age-based cleanup for old killer moves
- History score decay to prevent stale data
- Depth-aware killer move management
- Maximum size limits with intelligent eviction

### 3. Evaluation Cache Management
**Current State:** Simple position hash -> evaluation mapping
**Target Improvements:**
- TTL (time-to-live) for cached evaluations
- Separate caches for different evaluation components
- Memory usage monitoring and automatic cleanup
- Cache hit/miss ratio optimization

## Performance Auditing Framework

### 1. Memory Usage Profiling
- Real-time memory consumption tracking
- Peak memory usage identification
- Memory leak detection
- Allocation pattern analysis

### 2. Computational Waste Detection

- Inefficient loop pattern detection
- Unused variable elimination
- Dead code removal

### 3. Search Efficiency Metrics
- Nodes per second benchmarking
- Search tree pruning effectiveness
- Move ordering quality measurement
- Time management optimization

### 4. Cache Performance Analysis
- Hit/miss ratios for all caches
