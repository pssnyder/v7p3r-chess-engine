V7P3R v14.4 Tactical Improvement Framework

Based on diagnostic analysis of v14.3 performance on 1500+ puzzles:
1. Enhanced pin detection and evaluation
2. Improved tactical move ordering 
3. Better time allocation for tactical positions

Target: Improve from 77.5% to 85%+ accuracy on high-rating tactical puzzles
