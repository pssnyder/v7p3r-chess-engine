Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

When updating code files, be cautious not to remove functional code that is needed in order for files to run.
You're aim with code updates, enhancements, and even refactors should be to preserve existing functionality.
Unless instructed to remove features, all code should return the same outputs and function the same when you are done.
