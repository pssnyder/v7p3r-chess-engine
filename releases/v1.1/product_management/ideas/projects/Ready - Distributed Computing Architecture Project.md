        "# 1\\. Distributed Chess Engine Computing How-To Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide details how to set up a distributed computing network for your V7P3R Chess Engine, leveraging your existing Windows PCs and extending to a low-cost cloud environment like AWS. The goal is to efficiently run thousands or millions of game simulations and gather data for AI experimentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Principles for Distributed Chess Engine Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving into implementation, understanding these principles is key:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Decoupling**: Separate your application into distinct, independent services:\n",
        "      * **Game Runner/Worker**: An instance of your chess engine that plays games and generates data. This should be a lightweight, single-purpose unit.\n",
        "      * **Metrics Storage**: A centralized database to store all game results, move-by-move data, and configuration details. This is the single source of truth for your analytics.\n",
        "      * **Orchestration/Job Queue**: A system to manage and distribute game-playing tasks to available workers.\n",
        "      * **Dashboard**: A visualization layer to monitor progress and analyze collected data.\n",
        "  * **Stateless Workers**: Each game runner/worker should not retain state between game runs. It receives a task, executes it, reports results, and then is ready for a new, independent task. This simplifies scaling and fault tolerance.\n",
        "  * **Centralized Data**: All output data (PGNs, detailed move metrics, game results, configurations) must be sent to a single, shared database. This is crucial for aggregated analysis and A/B testing.\n",
        "  * **Scalability**: The architecture should allow you to easily add more workers (local PCs or cloud instances) to increase computational throughput without significant re-configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 1: Containerization with Docker\n",
        "\n",
        "Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit (a container), ensuring it runs consistently across different environments (your various Windows PCs, Linux micro-PCs, or cloud servers).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Install Docker\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **For Windows 10/11 Desktops/Laptops**: Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). Ensure WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) is enabled as Docker Desktop uses it for its backend.\n",
        "  * **For Linux (Orange Pi, Raspberry Pi)**: Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Create a `Dockerfile`\n",
        "\n",
        "In the root of your project, create a file named `Dockerfile`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```dockerfile\n",
        "# Dockerfile\n",

        "# Expose any ports if your application has a web interface (like the dashboard)\n",
        "# EXPOSE 8050 # For the Dash dashboard\n",
        "\n",
        "# Command to run your chess_game.py when the container starts\n",
        "# The arguments passed will be available in sys.argv in chess_game.py\n",
        "CMD [\"python\", \"chess_game.py\"]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Create `requirements.txt`\n",

        "```bash\n",
        "docker build -t v7p3r-chess-engine .\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This will create a Docker image named `v7p3r-chess-engine` which bundles your code and dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 2: Centralized Database\n",
        "\n",
        "SQLite is file-based and unsuitable for multiple concurrent writes from distributed workers, especially over a network. You need a robust, centralized database. PostgreSQL is an excellent open-source choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 Choose a Database Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Local Network**: Deploy **PostgreSQL** on one of your more powerful Windows desktops (e.g., the i9-11900k machine). You can run it directly or within Docker.\n",
        "      * **Direct Installation (Windows)**: Download and install PostgreSQL from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).\n",
        "      * **Dockerized PostgreSQL**:\n",
        "        ```bash\n",
        "        docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=securepassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "        This runs PostgreSQL in a container on a specified machine. Other machines can connect to `[IP_OF_POSTGRES_HOST]:5432`.\n",
        "  * **Cloud (AWS)**: Use **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**. This is a managed service, meaning AWS handles setup, backups, patching, and scaling. It's not free tier eligible for continuous use but can be cost-effective for burst testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Update `MetricsStore` for PostgreSQL\n",
        "\n",
        "Modify `metrics_store.py` to connect to PostgreSQL (or another SQL database) using SQLAlchemy."

        "**Key Changes in `metrics_store.py`:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **`__init__`**: Now accepts an optional `db_url`. If `None`, it defaults to SQLite. Otherwise, it uses `sqlalchemy.create_engine` to connect to the specified database (e.g., PostgreSQL).\n",
        "  * **`_initialize_database`**: Uses `sqlalchemy.schema.Table` and `MetaData.create_all` to define and create tables in a database-agnostic way. This automatically handles table creation and column additions more gracefully than raw SQL `ALTER TABLE` for cross-DB compatibility.\n",
        "  * **`_get_connection`**: Manages connections using SQLAlchemy's connection pool. It also starts a transaction, which is critical for concurrent database operations.\n",
        "  * **`_execute_with_retry`**: Adapted to use SQLAlchemy's connection execution, adding `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for `INSERT` statements to replicate SQLite's `INSERT OR IGNORE` behavior and handle concurrency.\n",
        "  * **`add_game_result` / `add_move_metric`**: Updated to use SQLAlchemy's `text()` construct for SQL queries with named parameters, improving readability and security against SQL injection.\n",
        "  * **`get_distinct_move_metric_names`**: Now uses SQLAlchemy's `inspect` module to dynamically query the schema of the `move_metrics` table, ensuring it only presents valid numeric columns for plotting.\n",
        "  * **`get_filtered_move_metrics`**: Enhanced to use SQLAlchemy's `text()` and parameterized queries for dynamic filtering based on AI types and selected metrics. It explicitly joins `move_metrics` with `game_results` to access AI configuration details. Returns a list of dictionaries for easier Dash consumption.\n",
        "  * **`close`**: Ensures proper disposal of the SQLAlchemy engine if an external database is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Action for You:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * You must modify `local_metrics_dashboard.py` to use the new `db_url` parameter when initializing `MetricsStore` if you want to use PostgreSQL. E.g., `metrics_store = MetricsStore(db_url=\"postgresql://chessuser:securepassword@localhost:5432/chess_metrics_db\")`. If left as `MetricsStore()`, it will continue using SQLite.\n",

        "\n",
        "  * **`apiVersion: batch/v1`, `kind: Job`**: Defines this as a Kubernetes Job.\n",
        "  * **`restartPolicy: Never`**: Important for Jobs; the container exits after completing its task and is not restarted.\n",
        "  * **`image: v7p3r-chess-engine:latest`**: Refers to the Docker image you built.\n",
        "  * **`imagePullPolicy: Never`**: Tells Kubernetes to not try to pull the image from a remote registry, assuming it's available locally on each node (you'll need to `docker load` or `docker push/pull` it if nodes don't share Docker daemon).\n",
        "  * **`env`**: Environment variables are passed to the container. This is how you'll pass database connection details and potentially override AI configurations for specific test runs.\n",
        "  * **`volumeMounts` / `volumes`**: This is how you'll make your Stockfish executable available *inside* the container. `hostPath` is used to mount a directory from the host machine directly into the container. **Adjust `path` to your exact Stockfish directory on your Windows hosts.**\n",
        "  * **`resources`**: Critical for resource allocation. You can specify CPU (e.g., \"500m\" for 0.5 CPU core, \"2\" for 2 CPU cores) and memory limits. This helps Kubernetes schedule jobs efficiently on your diverse hardware.\n",

        "## Step 4: Cloud Deployment Option (AWS)\n",
        "\n",
        "For scaling beyond your home network or for continuous, high-volume testing, AWS is a powerful option.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 AWS Services Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers (VMs) where you can run your Docker containers. You'd choose instance types with powerful GPUs for ML training or high-CPU instances for search-intensive work.\n",
        "      * **Pricing**: Pay-as-you-go per second. Spot Instances offer significant discounts for fault-tolerant workloads.\n",
        "  * **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) / EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Managed container orchestration services. ECS is simpler for basic Docker deployments, while EKS provides a fully managed Kubernetes experience.\n",
        "      * **AWS Fargate**: A compute engine for ECS/EKS that lets you run containers without managing servers. You only pay for the compute resources your containers use. Ideal for short-lived, burstable jobs like game simulations.\n",
        "  * **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). Simplifies database administration (backups, scaling, patching).\n",
        "      * **Pricing**: Instance-based, plus storage and I/O.\n",
        "  * **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage for large files (PGNs, model checkpoints, raw log data).\n",
        "  * **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging for all your AWS resources. Essential for observing resource usage, performance, and errors.\n",
        "  * **AWS Budgets**: Set custom cost alerts to monitor your spending and avoid surprises.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 AWS Deployment Strategy (Fargate for Workers, RDS for DB)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a good starting point for a cost-effective and managed deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Set up Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**:\n",
        "      * Go to the RDS console.\n",
        "      * Create a new PostgreSQL database instance. Choose a small instance size (e.g., `db.t3.micro` or `db.t4g.micro`) for low-cost testing.\n",
        "      * Configure public accessibility if accessing from local network for testing (disable for production for security).\n",
        "      * Note the endpoint (hostname), port, username, and password. Update your `MetricsStore`'s `db_url` and Dockerfile environment variables accordingly.\n",
        "2.  **Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**:\n",
        "      * Create a repository in ECR.\n",
        "      * Follow ECR's push commands to push your `v7p3r-chess-engine` Docker image:\n",
        "        ```bash\n",
        "        aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com\n",
        "        docker tag v7p3r-chess-engine:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/v7p3r-chess-engine:latest\n",
        "        docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/v7p3r-chess-engine:latest\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "3.  **Create an Amazon ECS Cluster**:\n",
        "      * In the ECS console, create a new ECS Cluster (choose Fargate as the capacity provider).\n",
        "4.  **Define an ECS Task Definition**:\n",
        "      * This specifies your Docker image, CPU/memory limits, environment variables (for DB connection), and volume mounts (if using EFS for shared data, though direct DB writes are preferred).\n",
        "      * For Stockfish executable, you'd either bundle it in the Docker image (which is what we set up) or mount it from EFS (if you need a shared, persistent file system across tasks, less common for binaries).\n",

        "      * In the ECS console, go to your cluster and select \"Run new Task\".\n",
        "      * Specify your task definition and the number of tasks to run (e.g., 100 tasks to run 10,000 games if each task plays 100 games).\n",
        "      * **Programmatic Execution**: For large-scale testing, you'd write a script (e.g., a Python script or AWS Lambda function) that uses the AWS SDK (Boto3) to launch many ECS tasks in parallel, possibly varying `AI_GAME_COUNT` or other AI parameters for A/B testing.\n",
        "6.  **Deploy the Dashboard (Streamlit Cloud or AWS App Runner)**:\n",
        "      * **Streamlit Cloud**: Easiest way. Connect your GitHub repo containing `local_metrics_dashboard.py` and `metrics_store.py`. Ensure your `metrics_store.py` connects to your **publicly accessible** AWS RDS endpoint. (Be mindful of security implications if exposing your DB publicly.)\n",
        "      * **AWS App Runner**: A fully managed service for deploying web applications and APIs. You provide your source code or a Docker image, and App Runner handles infrastructure. This would be a more robust and secure way to host your dashboard in AWS.\n",
        "7.  **Monitoring and Cost Management (CloudWatch, Budgets)**:\n",
        "      * **CloudWatch**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage of your ECS tasks. Set up alarms for high resource utilization or task failures. Stream container logs to CloudWatch Logs for debugging.\n",
        "      * **AWS Budgets**: Set up monthly budgets for your EC2/Fargate and RDS costs. Configure alerts (email/SNS) when your actual or forecasted spend approaches your budget limit. This is crucial for controlling costs in the cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.3 Key Considerations for Your Hardware\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Mixed Hardware**: Your diverse set of Windows PCs (i9, i5, older desktop, laptop, mini-PCs) can all serve as Docker hosts and Kubernetes nodes. The `requests` and `limits` in Kubernetes YAMLs are important to ensure tasks are scheduled on nodes with sufficient resources.\n",
        "  * **GPU Utilization**: For future ML integration, direct GPU access in Kubernetes (especially on Windows) is complex.\n",
        "      * **Local Kubernetes**: Requires specific drivers and GPU-aware Docker runtimes (e.g., NVIDIA Container Toolkit) on each node. K3s has some experimental support for GPU passthrough.\n",
        "      * **Cloud (AWS)**: EC2 instances offer GPU instances (e.g., `p3`, `g4dn`, `g5` families) that come with NVIDIA drivers pre-installed. Fargate generally does not offer GPU instances, so you'd use EC2 instances managed by ECS/EKS for GPU workloads.\n",
        "  * **Storage**: For local Kubernetes, you might need a Network File System (NFS) or SMB share if your workers need shared file access (e.g., for large datasets for ML training). For metrics, stick to the central database.\n",
        "  * **Network (LAN)**: Ensure reliable network connectivity between all your local PCs and the PostgreSQL host. Hardwiring (Gigabit Ethernet) is always preferred over Wi-Fi for stability and performance.\n",

        "This guide outlines how to build four additional AI types for your V7P3R Chess Engine, leveraging machine learning techniques and integrating them with your existing evaluation logic and the overall `chess_game.py` framework. This will allow your AI to learn from data and improve its play, and be compatible with external chess GUIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview of New AI Types\n",
        "\n",
        "We will define how to implement the following AI types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **V7P3R NN AI Engine (Supervised Learning)**: Learns moves from existing human-played PGN data.\n",
        "2.  **V7P3R Genetic AI Engine**: Evolves evaluation parameters using genetic algorithms, driven by performance against other AIs.\n",
        "3.  **V7P3R Reinforcement AI Engine**: Learns through self-play by receiving rewards/penalties from game outcomes and evaluation scores.\n",
        "4.  **V7P3R Hybrid NN-Search Engine**: Integrates a neural network directly into your existing search algorithms (e.g., for leaf node evaluation or move ordering).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Integration Points for New AI Types\n",
        "\n",
        "All new AI types will need to conform to an interface similar to your existing `EvaluationEngine` and `StockfishHandler` to be plug-and-play within `chess_game.py`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.0 General Structure for a New AI Engine\n",
        "\n",
        "Each new AI engine type will primarily exist as a new Python class, similar to `EvaluationEngine` and `StockfishHandler`.\n",
        "\n",
        "It will need:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **`__init__(self, board: chess.Board, player: chess.Color, ai_config: dict)`**: Initializes the engine with the current board, player color, and specific AI configuration (from `config.yaml`).\n",
        "  * **`search(self, board: chess.Board, player: chess.Color, ai_config: dict, stop_callback=None)`**: This is the primary method called by `chess_game.py` to get a move. It should return a `chess.Move` object.\n",
        "  * **`evaluate_position_from_perspective(self, board: chess.Board, player: chess.Color)`**: Returns a numerical evaluation of the board from the given player's perspective. This is crucial for the dashboard and for internal reward/penalty functions.\n",
        "  * **`reset(self, board: chess.Board)`**: Resets the AI's internal state for a new game.\n",
        "  * **Configuration in `config.yaml`**: Add a new `ai_type` and `engine` entry, along with any specific parameters for that AI (e.g., `model_path`, `mutation_rate`).\n",

        "  * **`train.py`**: This script would be very similar to the supervised learning train script, but the dataset preparation would specifically filter for your games.\n",

        "      * As long as your new AI classes implement the `search()` and `evaluate_position_from_perspective()` methods (or adapt to what the `LichessBot` expects for move generation and evaluation), integration should be straightforward.\n",
        "  * **Nibbler and Other GUIs**: These GUIs expect a UCI-compatible executable.\n",
        "      * You would use `PyInstaller` (as hinted in `package_exe.py`) to create a standalone executable for a dedicated UCI interface script. This script would act as a wrapper, taking UCI commands from the GUI and passing them to your chosen AI engine internally.\n",
