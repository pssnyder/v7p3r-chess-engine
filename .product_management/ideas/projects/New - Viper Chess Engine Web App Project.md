## Viper Chess Engine Web App (Streamlit Version)
### Project Overview
This project aims to create a lightweight, performant web version of the v7p3r chess engine using Streamlit. The goal is to allow users to play chess against an AI or watch AI vs. AI matches directly in their browser, while providing a user-friendly interface and configuration options.

---

## High-Level Project Goals

- Build a lightweight, performant web version of the v7p3r chess engine using Streamlit.
- Use the engine’s `deepsearch` function for efficient AI play.
- Allow human vs. AI and AI vs. AI chess matches in the browser.
- Provide a configuration UI for limited bot customization and randomization.
- Optimize for resource usage and restrict advanced settings for web users.
- Ensure a smooth, dark-themed user interface reusing existing board/piece assets.
- Package and deploy for easy web access, with resource safety boundaries.
- Provide an updated, cohesive README file for the repository.

## Project Tasks (for GitHub Project/Issues)

### 1. **Project Initialization**

- [ ] Review existing files: `viper_app.py`, `viper_app.yaml`, and source modules.
- [ ] Identify and document all dependencies needed for the Streamlit web app.

### 2. **Streamlit Web App Development**

- [ ] Set up Streamlit app structure using `viper_app.py` as the entry point.
- [ ] Integrate `deepsearch` as the main search function for the chess engine.
- [ ] Implement Human vs. AI gameplay interface with chessboard and move input.
- [ ] Implement AI vs. AI mode with two randomly configured viper engine instances.
- [ ] Display engine configurations for both bots. Add randomize and user input options (with boundaries).
- [ ] Restrict user configuration to safe parameters (scoring, bot type, depth ≤ 4, quiescence = True).
- [ ] Reuse dark theme and custom chess piece assets from existing codebase.
- [ ] Implement efficient state management for both game types.

### 3. **Performance Optimization**

- [ ] Limit AI search depth to 4 (plus quiescence) for web version.
- [ ] Hide or hardcode advanced settings that could degrade performance or break the game.
- [ ] Profile app performance and optimize code for Streamlit/browser environment.
- [ ] Implement resource usage boundary checks to prevent overuse on free hosting.

### 4. **Configuration UI**

- [ ] Design and build a streamlined configuration panel for bot options (safe subset only).
- [ ] Provide randomization and user entry for limited engine parameters.
- [ ] Match the style and UX of previous config UI efforts from the desktop project.

### 5. **User Interface & Theming**

- [ ] Apply dark theme and use existing chessboard/piece assets.
- [ ] Ensure UI is smooth, responsive, and visually appealing.
- [ ] Test interface across devices and browsers.

### 6. **Deployment**

- [ ] Research best practices for packaging and deploying Streamlit apps (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, Vercel, etc.).
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts/configuration as needed.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated deployment to chosen platform.
- [ ] Add resource safety boundaries and error handling for public hosting.

### 7. **Documentation**

- [ ] Review all code files in the repo for documentation and usage patterns.
- [ ] Write a comprehensive, cohesive README covering:
  - Project overview and goals
  - Main features (human vs. AI, AI vs. AI, config UI, theming)
  - Installation and setup instructions
  - How to contribute
  - Deployment guidelines
  - Performance safeguards and boundaries
  - Credits and asset licensing

### 8. **Testing & Feedback**

- [ ] Test all features thoroughly (gameplay, config, deployment).
- [ ] Solicit user feedback for improvements.
- [ ] Address bugs and polish before final release.

## Example Breakdown of Issues/Project Items

You can create a Project board with the above tasks as columns/cards, and generate issues for each checklist item (or group related ones). For each item, you can link related branches, PRs, and deployment steps as you work through the workflow.

---

## Deployment Recommendations

- **Best platforms for Streamlit apps:**  
  - [Streamlit Community Cloud (streamlit.io)](https://streamlit.io/cloud) - free for small apps, easy to set up.
  - [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) - supports Streamlit, good for AI demos.
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for more control (may require Dockerization).
  - **Tip:** Add a requirements.txt and ensure your app runs with minimal memory/CPU for sustainable free hosting.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create a GitHub Project** using the default template.
2. **Add items** for each of the above tasks.
3. **Convert items to issues** as needed for tracking and delegation.
4. **Assign branches/PRs** as you work through each task.
5. **Deploy and iterate** based on user feedback and performance testing.

Would you like me to:
- Auto-create the initial issues for these tasks?
- Start drafting the new cohesive README based on your current files?
- Set up a sample deployment workflow file for Streamlit?

Let me know how you want to proceed!
