# Distributed Computing Architecture Project Update and Rescope

## Revised Project Status

### Phase 1: Data Server Management
- **Status:** ALMOST COMPLETE (80%)
- The basic server/client model for centralized data collection is largely implemented.
- Scope simplified: only centralized data collection is needed, not distributed node-to-node communication.

### Phase 2: Worker Node Management
- **Status:** COMPLETE (100%)
- All missing items removed from scope.
- Current local parallel simulation capability is sufficient.

### Phase 3: Reporting Layer and Metrics Data Access
- **Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE (40-50%)
- Need to complete ETL functionality to process raw simulation data into structured reporting data.
- Scheduled data processing (not real-time) is required.

### Phase 4: Metrics Dashboard Updates
- **Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE (50%)
- Basic dashboard exists but needs to connect to centralized data sources.
- Real-time updates are out of scope; scheduled updates are sufficient.

## Implementation Plan

Based on the updated scope, here is a prioritized implementation plan to complete the project:

### Complete Phase 1: Central Data Collection Server
- **Task 1.1:** Review and resolve any remaining TODOs in `engine_db_manager.py`
- **Task 1.2:** Enhance `cloud_store.py` to support bulk uploads of simulation data
- **Task 1.3:** Create a data schema for raw simulation data storage in the cloud
- **Task 1.4:** Implement client-side functionality to send simulation data to central server
- **Task 1.5:** Add error handling and retry logic for network disconnections

### Complete Phase 3: ETL for Reporting Layer
- **Task 3.1:** Develop ETL process to transform raw game data into structured metrics
- **Task 3.2:** Create a scheduled job to run the ETL process (e.g., daily)
- **Task 3.3:** Implement data validation and cleanup for corrupt or incomplete game records
- **Task 3.4:** Design optimized schema for analytics in the reporting layer
- **Task 3.5:** Add logging and monitoring for ETL processes

### Complete Phase 4: Metrics Dashboard
- **Task 4.1:** Update `engine_monitor.app.py` to connect to cloud-based reporting data
- **Task 4.2:** Add configuration options to specify data source (local or cloud)
- **Task 4.3:** Implement caching to improve dashboard performance
- **Task 4.4:** Add data freshness indicators to show when the data was last updated
- **Task 4.5:** Create summary visualizations for engine performance over time

### Testing & Documentation
- **Task T.1:** Create test scenarios for the central data collection system
- **Task T.2:** Test ETL processes with various input data scenarios
- **Task T.3:** Benchmark performance of the metrics dashboard with large datasets
- **Task T.4:** Document data flow architecture and update project README
- **Task T.5:** Create usage guides for running simulations and viewing metrics

### Integration & Deployment
- **Task I.1:** Update `simulation_config.yaml` to include cloud storage settings
- **Task I.2:** Create configuration profiles for different environments (dev/test/prod)
- **Task I.3:** Set up authentication and security for cloud resources
- **Task I.4:** Create installation/setup scripts for new environments

This implementation plan focuses on completing the centralized data collection and reporting functionality while removing the distributed computing aspects that are out of scope. The plan prioritizes the core data flow from simulation to storage to reporting, aligning with the goal of having a consistent way to analyze engine performance across multiple machines.
