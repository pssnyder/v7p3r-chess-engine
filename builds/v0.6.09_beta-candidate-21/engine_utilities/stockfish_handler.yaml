# Stockfish Engine Configuration
stockfish:
  path: engine_utilities/external_engines/stockfish/stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe # Path to Stockfish executable

  # Search parameters
  depth: 2                # Depth of search for Stockfish (overrides skill_level if set)
  max_depth: 4            # Max depth of search for Stockfish (used for iterative deepening)
  movetime: null          # Time in ms per move (null for no limit)
  nodes: null             # Number of nodes to search (null for no limit)

  # UCI options
  skill_level: 1          # Stockfish skill level (0 = weakest, 20 = strongest)
  elo_rating: 100         # Set an ELO rating (e.g., 1000, 2000, null for max strength)
  uci_limit_strength: true # If true, Stockfish will use ELO rating (set UCI_LimitStrength)
  contempt: 100             # Contempt value (-100 to 100, 0 = neutral, positive = prefer draws as White, negative = as Black)
  threads: 1              # Number of threads Stockfish should use
  hash: 64                # Hash size in MB
  ponder: false           # Enable pondering (thinking on opponent's time)
  multi_pv: 2             # Number of principal variations to calculate (1 = best line only)
  debug_stockfish: false  # Enable debug logging for Stockfish engine (can be very verbose)

  # Additional UCI options for advanced testing
  syzygy_path: null       # Path to Syzygy tablebases (null to disable)
  syzygy_probe_depth: 1   # Minimum depth for Syzygy probing
  uci_chess960: false     # Enable Chess960 mode if needed

  # Notes:
  # - If both depth and skill_level are set, depth takes precedence.
  # - If uci_limit_strength is true and elo_rating is set, Stockfish will play at the specified ELO.
  # - For lowest strength, set skill_level: 0 and elo_rating: 1000 (or lower).
  # - For strongest play, set skill_level: 20 and elo_rating: null.
