    "# Viper Chess Engine Big Overhaul Project: Primary Update Documentation\n",

    "### Phase 1: Core Engine Functionality & Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Establish robust core engine functionality and ensure accurate data collection for game analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Update Configuration File Handling**: Modify the codebase to correctly load settings from the new YAML file structure (`viper.yaml`, `chess_game.yaml`, `stockfish_handler.yaml`).\n",
    "2.  **Ensure Automated Game Play**: Verify that `chess_game.py` can run an AI vs. AI game (e.g., Viper vs. Stockfish) using the updated configurations and save game data (PGN, config, logs).\n",
    "3.  **Basic Metrics Collection**: Confirm that essential game metrics (result, players, length, configurations) are being saved."

    "### Phase 2: Configuration GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Develop a user-friendly graphical interface for managing engine and game configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Design Configuration Data Structure**: Determine how configurations will be stored and managed (e.g., a JSON file or a simple database) to allow for saving, loading, and creating new named configurations.\n",
    "2.  **Implement GUI for Viper Settings**: Build out `viper_gui.app.py` (likely using Flask or Streamlit) to:\n",
    "    * Load existing configurations.\n",
    "    * Display current settings from `viper.yaml`.\n",
    "    * Allow users to modify these settings.\n",
    "    * Save changes back to `viper.yaml` or a new named configuration.\n",
    "    * Allow users to select which named configuration is \"active\" for the engine.\n",
    "3.  **Implement GUI for Game Settings**: Extend the GUI to manage settings in `chess_game.yaml`.\n",
    "4.  **Implement GUI for Stockfish Settings**: Extend the GUI to manage settings in `stockfish_handler.yaml`."

    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Refine the engine monitoring dashboard and address outstanding code tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Update `engine_monitor.app.py`**: Refactor the Streamlit dashboard based on TODO notes, focusing on historical analysis and removing real-time/log-based features not relevant to its new scope.\n",
    "2.  **Address Code TODOs**: Systematically go through the codebase, identify all TODO comments, and implement them.\n",
    "3.  **Adaptive ELO (Stretch Goal)**: If time permits and core functionality is stable, begin planning/implementing the adaptive ELO for opponent AI in `chess_game.py`."
