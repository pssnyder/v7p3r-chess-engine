# Development Archive

This directory contains development artifacts, experimental code, and historical files that are not part of the core v12.0 release but are preserved for reference.

## Directory Structure

### `v11_experiments/`
Contains all v11.x experimental files, tests, and development artifacts:
- v11.5 experimental implementations
- v11 test files and validation scripts
- v11 UCI test scripts
- Performance analysis from v11 development

### `old_builds/`
Contains build scripts and specifications from previous versions:
- v11.x build scripts (.bat files)
- PyInstaller specification files from v11.x
- Legacy build processes and configurations

### `debug/`
Contains debug utilities and test files:
- Debug test scripts
- Performance analysis tools
- Development utilities

### Root Development Files
Legacy development files from earlier versions (v9, v10 era):
- Backup implementations
- Alternative evaluation approaches
- Tactical pattern detectors
- Scoring calculation variants

## Purpose

This archive serves multiple purposes:
1. **Historical Reference**: Preserve lessons learned and experimental approaches
2. **Code Archaeology**: Reference implementations for future development
3. **Rollback Capability**: Access to previous implementations if needed
4. **Documentation**: Examples of what was tried and why it was abandoned

## V12.0 Clean Foundation

V12.0 represents a clean slate built from:
- v10.8 stable baseline (19.5/30 tournament recovery)
- Enhanced nudge system (proven v11 improvement)
- Improved time management (v11 lessons learned)
- Code cleanup (experimental features removed)

All files in this development archive are **not** part of the v12.0 core codebase but are preserved for historical and reference purposes.
