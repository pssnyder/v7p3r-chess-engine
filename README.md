**Achievement:** 50% vs Stockfish 1% (Rating Parity) ⭐  
**Infrastructure:** Professional cloud deployment with 99.9% uptime  
**Development Focus:** Performance optimization + Future multi-threading + DESC AI system

### V16.1 Key Enhancements

1. **🔥 Deep Opening Repertoire (15 moves)**
   - 52+ positions programmed with center-control focus
   - White: Italian Game (Giuoco Piano), Queen's Gambit Declined, King's Indian Attack
   - Black: Sicilian Najdorf, King's Indian Defense, French Defense, Caro-Kann
   - Smooth transition from opening to middlegame

2. **⚡ Middlegame Transition Nudges**
   - Rook activity: +20cp (open files), +10cp (semi-open files)
   - King safety: +10cp per pawn shield
   - Pawn structure: +30cp (passed pawns), -20cp (doubled pawns)
   - Intelligent piece placement bonuses

3. **♟️ Syzygy Tablebase Integration**
   - Perfect 6-piece endgame play (when tablebases available)
   - WDL (Win/Draw/Loss) probing for guaranteed optimal moves
   - Graceful fallback to heuristic search if tablebases unavailable

4. **🐛 Critical Bug Fix**
   - Fixed "no move found" bug in drawn positions (K vs K, insufficient material)
   - Changed from `is_game_over()` to specific `is_checkmate()` / `is_stalemate()` checks
   - **This bug caused Arena's "illegal move" error in V16.0**

### V16.1 Architecture

**Core Formula:**
```
Evaluation = (PST × 60%) + (Material × 40%) + Middlegame Bonuses
```

**Three-Phase Excellence:**
- **Opening (Moves 1-15):** Deep book with center control theory
- **Middlegame:** Positional bonuses for piece activity, king safety, pawn structure
- **Endgame (≤6 pieces):** Perfect play via Syzygy tablebases (or strong heuristics)

3. **Optional: Configure Syzygy Tablebases:**
   - Download 3-4-5 piece tablebases from [Syzygy Download](http://tablebase.sesse.net/syzygy/)
   - In Arena, set UCI option: `setoption name SyzygyPath value C:\path\to\tablebases`

---

## ⚙️ UCI Options

| Option | Type | Default | Range | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **MaxDepth** | spin | 6 | 1-20 | Maximum search depth (V16.1: 6-10 recommended) |
| **TTSize** | spin | 128 | 16-2048 | Transposition table size in MB |
| **SyzygyPath** | string | (empty) | - | Path to Syzygy tablebase files (V16.1) |

### Configuration Examples

```uci
# Standard tournament settings
setoption name MaxDepth value 8
setoption name TTSize value 256

# With tablebases for perfect endgames
setoption name SyzygyPath value /path/to/syzygy
setoption name MaxDepth value 10
```

## 🎮 Playing Style

### V16.1 Strengths

1. **🔥 Opening Mastery**
   - 52 positions deep (15 moves)
   - Center control focus (Italian, QGD, Sicilian Najdorf, KID)
   - Smooth book exit transitions

2. **⚡ Middlegame Excellence**
   - Material safety (never sacrifices without compensation)
   - Active piece placement (PST-guided)
   - Rook activity detection (+20cp open files)
   - King safety awareness (+10cp per shield pawn)
   - Pawn structure intelligence (passed pawns, doubled pawns)

3. **♟️ Endgame Mastery**
   - **With Tablebases:** Perfect 6-piece play (forced wins)
   - **Without Tablebases:** Strong PST + material heuristics
   - King centralization in endgames
   - Passed pawn promotion technique

4. **🛡️ Tactical Awareness**
   - Pre-search move filtering (material safety)
   - Quiescence search (tactical stability)
   - Mate detection (finds checkmate in 1-2 moves)
   - King safety preservation (castling prioritized)

### V16.1 Characteristics

**Target Depth:** 8-10 (standard time controls)  
**Nodes/Second:** 3,000-10,000 (position dependent)  
**Opening Book Usage:** Moves 1-15 (52+ positions)  
**Evaluation Speed:** ~5-10ms per position  

### Ideal Opponents

- **Competitive Against:** C0BR4 v3.2 (primary target), material-focused engines
- **Challenging:** Super-tactical engines, deep search specialists (>12 depth)
- **Beats:** Engines without opening books, weak endgame play

### Known Limitations

1. **Depth Limitation:** Targets 8-10 depth (not ultra-deep search)
2. **Tactical Horizon:** May miss deep (5+ move) tactical sequences
3. **Time Management:** Basic time allocation (can be optimized)
4. **No Neural Networks:** Classical evaluation only

## 🔬 Performance Benchmarks

### V16.1 Test Results (November 19, 2025)

| Test Category | Result | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Opening Book** | ✅ Pass | 52 positions loaded, all book moves valid |
| **Middlegame Bonuses** | ✅ Pass | +10 to +30cp applied correctly |
| **Endgame (No TB)** | ✅ Pass | Strong heuristic play (KR vs K, KQ vs K) |
| **Mate Finding** | ✅ Pass | Mate in 1 found instantly (29999cp) |
| **Tactical Awareness** | ⚠️ Partial | Finds forks/checks, depth-limited on deep tactics |
| **Bug Fix** | ✅ Fixed | "No move found" bug eliminated |

### Benchmark Positions

**Starting Position** (depth 6, 1s):
- Move: d4
- Eval: 0cp (balanced)
- Nodes: ~267

**Complex Middlegame** (depth 2, 0.06s):
- Move: Qd3
- Eval: +46cp (White advantage)
- Rook bonus applied: +0cp (no open files yet)

**K vs K Draw** (depth 2, 0.005s):
- Move: Ke5
- Eval: +24cp (centeralization)
- **Previously failed** (V16.0 bug) ✅ Now fixed

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### V16.1 Bug Fix: "No Move Found"

**Issue:** V16.0 returned `None` in drawn-by-insufficient-material positions (K vs K, KN vs K), causing Arena to flag "illegal move."

**Root Cause:** Used `board.is_game_over()` which returns `True` for:
- ✓ Checkmate/Stalemate (correct)
- ✗ Insufficient material draws (incorrect - still have moves)
- ✗ 50-move rule (incorrect - still have moves)

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (buggy):
if board.is_game_over():
    return None

# After (fixed):
if board.is_checkmate():
    return -MATE_SCORE + ply, None
if board.is_stalemate():
    return 0, None
# Continue searching in all other cases
```

**Validation:** ✅ All drawn positions now return legal moves

### V12.6 (October 2025) - Champion
- **Engine Battle 20251004:** 7.0/10 points (2nd place)
- **Regression Battle 20251004:** 9.0/12 points (1st place vs all V7P3R versions)
- **Performance:** 30x faster than V12.2 baseline
