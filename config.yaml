# AI Types
ai_types: [
  'deepsearch',         # Dynamic deep search with time control and iterative deepening - deepsearch is a custom search algorithm designed for the Viper engine that adjusts its depth and choice of algorithms based on the complexity and decision time for the position, more volatile and time consuming positions are given a wider and deeper search with less time boundaries to explore moves, while more stable positions are given a narrower and shallower search with faster increments to incentivize fast stable play. 
  'lookahead',          # Lookahead search with max value comparison - lookahead is a simple max evaluation comparison search algorithm that performs similar to simple_search but is able to see moves several plies in deep into the move tree, it is compatible with deepsearch and dynamic search depths, its primary advantage is its simplistic move comparison logic that provides 100% coverage with no pruning, recommended max depth is 4 due to exponential growth of the move tree, it is a basic search algorithm that is used in chess engines to find the best move for the current position 
  'minimax',            # Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning - minimax is a standard search algorithm for two-player games, where player A chooses the move that maximizes their score then player B choses a move trying to minimize player A's score, back and forth, it assumes that the evaluation function is symmetric, meaning that the evaluation for a position is the negative of the evaluation for the position with colors swapped, it uses a single evaluation and inverts the best move selection for the opponents turn, it is the most basic loop based search algorithm used in a chess engine
  'negamax',            # Negamax search with alpha-beta pruning - negamax is a variant of minimax that simplifies the implementation - it assumes that the evaluation function is symmetric, meaning that the evaluation for a position is the negative of the evaluation for the position with colors swapped, it uses a single evaluation function and negates the score for the opponent's turn, this allows for a more efficient search tree traversal, it also uses alpha-beta pruning to reduce the number of nodes evaluated, negamax is a more efficient version of minimax that is commonly used in chess engines
  'negascout',          # Negascout search with alpha-beta pruning - negascout is an optimization of negamax that reduces the number of nodes evaluated by playing a null move, i.e. skipping a turn to test a moves stability and tempo, valuable moves that gain tempo should survive two consecutive opponent moves without losing a set threshold of the evaluation, negascout is a more efficient version of negamax due to its stricter alpha beta pruning criteria based on scoring trends, commonly used in chess engines but not without quiescence for added blind spot protections, it is also known as principal variation search
  'transposition_only', # Transposition table search - transposition is a technique that stores previously evaluated positions to avoid redundant calculations
  'simple_search',      # Simple 1 ply search that returns the best move based on and evaluation of every legal move in the the immediate position from the active players perspective, it assumes symmetry in the position and both White and Black's scores are calculated based on absolute, not inverse values like negamax. it returns the best move for the current player in their immediate position, it is the least intelligent and least efficient of all searches, it maintains 100% coverage of the current position but only because it must still investigate all legal moves for the position without pruning, it also lacks forward memory and has no course of action after the first move in the sequence, not useful play over 500 ELO
  'quiescence_only',    # Quiescence search that evaluates only stable positions, ignoring non-capturing moves, it is a search algorithm that is used in chess engines to find the best move for the current position, it is a basic search algorithm that is used in chess engines to find the best move for the current position, it is not very efficient but it is easy to implement and understand
  'simple_eval',        # Simple evaluation function that returns a score based on material balance and piece-square tables, it is a basic evaluation function that is used in chess engines to find the best move for the current position, it is not very efficient but it is easy to implement and understand
  'random'              # Random move selection, it randomly selects a move from the legal moves available, it is a basic unintelligent search algorithm that is used as a control for testing purposes, it is not very efficient but it is easy to implement and understand
