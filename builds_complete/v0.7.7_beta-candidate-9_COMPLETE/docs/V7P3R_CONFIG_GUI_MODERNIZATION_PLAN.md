# V7P3R Config GUI Modernization Plan

## Overview
Update the v7p3r_config_gui.py to align with current system architecture and fix all outstanding issues.

## Issues to Address

### 1. Logging Centralization
- Remove all old logging setup code
- Use only centralized logging from v7p3r_debug
- Clean up broken formatter references

### 2. Configuration Structure Updates
- Update to use current v7p3rConfig class structure
- Align with configs/default_config.json format
- Support all config sections: game_config, engine_config, stockfish_config, etc.

### 3. Ruleset Integration
- Use configs/rulesets/ruleset_template.json as the source of truth
- Support new ruleset structure with modifier metadata
- Enable editing of modifier values with descriptions

### 4. Modern GUI Features
- Update engine options based on available modules
- Fix import issues with v7p3rChess
- Support all configuration sections
- Improve user experience with better validation

### 5. File Structure Alignment
- Use proper config directory (configs/ not v7p3r_engine/configs/)
- Support saving/loading with current config format
- Integrate with existing configuration system
