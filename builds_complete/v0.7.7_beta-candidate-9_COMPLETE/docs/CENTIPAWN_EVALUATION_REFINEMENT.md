# Centipawn Evaluation System Refinement

## Overview
This document outlines the changes needed to refine the V7P3R chess engine's evaluation system to use standard centipawn values consistently. The goal is to make the evaluation more representative of actual chess positions and make it easier to understand the impact of scoring functions.

## Current Issues
1. Inconsistent piece value representations: Some files use direct values (P=1.0), others use centipawns (P=100)
2. Score modifiers may be causing score inflation beyond typical centipawn ranges
3. Final evaluation scores are sometimes very large (1500+), making it hard to interpret advantage

## Planned Changes

### Phase 1: Standardize Piece Values
1. Update `v7p3r_pst.py` to use consistent centipawn values
2. Ensure `get_piece_value()` returns proper centipawn values without additional multiplication
3. Adjust any other piece value references to use the standard centipawn scale

### Phase 2: Review and Adjust Modifiers
1. Check all score modifiers in `v7p3r_rules.py` to ensure they don't inflate scores unreasonably
2. Normalize component scores to maintain proper centipawn scale

### Phase 3: Refine Final Evaluation
1. Add normalization in the final score calculation in `v7p3r_score.py`
2. Ensure that evaluation differences properly reflect position advantage

### Testing Plan
After each phase, run test games to verify:
1. The engine makes reasonable moves
2. Evaluation scores are within expected centipawn ranges
3. Evaluation differences correspond to actual position strength

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: Immediate implementation
- Phase 2: After testing Phase 1
- Phase 3: After testing Phase 2

All changes will be made incrementally with testing after each step to ensure engine stability and proper functionality.
