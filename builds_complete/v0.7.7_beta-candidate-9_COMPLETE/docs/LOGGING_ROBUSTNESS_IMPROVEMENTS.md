# Logging Robustness Improvements

## Problem
The V7P3R Chess Engine was experiencing `KeyboardInterrupt` errors during logging operations, particularly when checking if a log file exists or if it's a file (vs. a directory). This would happen when:

1. The engine was interrupted during file operations
2. There were permission or file access issues
3. Network or disk latency caused operations to take too long
4. Multiple processes/threads tried to access the same log files

## Solution
We've implemented several improvements to make the logging system more robust:

1. **Enhanced `SafeRotatingFileHandler`**:
   - Added proper thread-safety with locks
   - Improved error handling, especially for `KeyboardInterrupt`
   - Added a throttling mechanism to reduce file system checks
   - Implemented a more reliable file size checking method
   - Ensured graceful fallback to console logging when file access fails

2. **Non-blocking Logging During Shutdown**:
   - Added `NonBlockingHandler` to handle keyboard interrupts gracefully
   - Prevents logging operations from blocking application shutdown
   - Safely ignores logging errors during program termination
   - Wraps existing handlers to add shutdown protection

3. **Thread-safe Logger Management**:
   - Added a global cache of logger instances
   - Used thread locks to prevent race conditions
   - Reused existing loggers to avoid duplicate handlers
   - Implemented proper cleanup of old handlers

4. **Testing Support**:
   - Added a `disable_logging_for_tests()` method to completely disable logging during tests
   - This prevents file access conflicts in test environments and makes tests run faster

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Maintained compatibility with existing code
   - Updated deprecated methods to use the new approach
   - Improved error messages for deprecated methods

## Usage

### Regular Logging
```python
from v7p3r_debug import v7p3rLogger

# Get a logger for your module
logger = v7p3rLogger.setup_logger("my_module_name")

# Use the logger
logger.debug("Debug message")
logger.info("Info message")
logger.warning("Warning message")
logger.error("Error message")
logger.critical("Critical message")
```

### Disabling Logging for Tests
```python
from v7p3r_debug import v7p3rLogger

# Disable all logging before running tests
v7p3rLogger.disable_logging_for_tests()

# Now run your tests...
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: The system can now handle file access issues, interruptions, and concurrent access without crashing.
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: When file logging fails, the system automatically falls back to console logging.
3. **Performance**: Throttling mechanisms reduce excessive file system operations.
4. **Testing Support**: Disabling logging during tests prevents file access conflicts and speeds up test execution.
5. **Thread Safety**: The system is now thread-safe, preventing race conditions and other concurrency issues.
6. **Graceful Interruption**: KeyboardInterrupt is now handled gracefully without hanging or crashing.

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Monitor for Errors**: Continue to monitor for any logging-related errors in production.
2. **Configuration Options**: Consider adding configuration options for log levels, file sizes, etc.
3. **Log Rotation Policies**: Review log rotation policies to ensure they meet your needs.
4. **Cleanup**: Consider adding a log cleanup utility to remove old logs.
